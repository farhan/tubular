## Overview
Python scripts for integrating pipelines with various services/tools such as:
* Asgard
* Amazon Web Services EC2
* GitHub
* Jenkins
* Drupal

The scripts perform work to enable continuous delivery (CD) for https://edx.org. These scripts are called from various tasks/jobs/stages in GoCD pipelines - but could be called from any automation/CD framework.
